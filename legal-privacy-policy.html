			<p class="abt-text">Our data bases are being reviewed regularly and private data that is not relevant to us any more will be deleted by us.</p>
			<p class="abt-text"><strong>3.3 Visiting the website and contacting us</strong></p>
			<p class="abt-text"><strong>3.3.1 Site visitation tracking</strong><br />
			<strong>Google Analytics</strong><br />
			Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.</p>
			<p class="abt-text">Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. GA also records your computer's IP address which could be used to personally identify you, but Google does not grant us access to this. We consider Google to be a 3<sup>rd</sup> party data processor (see section 3.6.1 below).</p>
			<p class="abt-text">GA makes use of cookies, details of which can be found on <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage">Google's developer guides</a>. FYI our website uses the analytics.js implementation of GA.</p>
			<p class="abt-text">Disabling cookies on your internet browser will stop GA from tracking any part of your visit to pages within this website.</p>

			Should you choose to contact us using the contact form or by requesting for white papers or case studies to be sent to you, either on our client facing or franchise facing pages, or by sending an email directly to one of our employees' or franchisees' emails that are stated on the website, none of the data that you supply will be stored by this website or passed to / be processed by any of the third party data processors defined in section 3.6.1.</p>
			<p class="abt-text">Instead the data will be collated into an email and sent over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a>. Our SMTP servers are protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> (sometimes known as SSL) meaning that the email content is encrypted using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-2</a>, 256-bit cryptography before being sent across the internet. The email content is then decrypted by our local computers and devices.</p>
			<p class="abt-text">Our hosting Provider Flywheel setup the server to use the SendGrid service to send emails securely and reliably. More information on their security practices can be found <a href="https://sendgrid.com/policies/security/">here</a>.</p>

			<p class="abt-text">You can opt-out of receiving automated emails from us by clicking on "unsubscribe" on the bottom of one of the emails.</p>
			<p class="abt-text">We consider these providers to be 3<sup>rd</sup> party data processors (see section 3.6 below). The email address and further information that you submit will not be stored within this website's own database.</p>
